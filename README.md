# Rental-property-analysis

This project marks the beginning of my journey with Python, my secondary coding language. The purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding of data analytics and visualization, while pushing my understanding of the language to the next level. The reason I chose data analytics/visualization is because this is one of Python's strong suits, and thought that learning how the ETL data pipeline process works would prove to be valuable for the future. My project consisted and extracting data from a CSV and a pickle file and then cleaning the data to make it usuable for insights on market trends. The results of my code are shown below.

A short snippet of a 10000 point data set is shown below to show the quality of the original data:

The following image shows how the data looked after extracting and transforming it:

After performing ETL process on the data set we obtained the following visualizations:
